## Income share of the bottom quintile.

Given a variable *X* distributed lognormally,$ *X* ~ lognorm(*mu*, *sigma*), for an arbitrary percentile *p* how do I integrate the cumulative share of X over the interval (0,*p*).

In other words, if *p*=.20, what is the sum of *X* for the bottom quintile of the distribution?
