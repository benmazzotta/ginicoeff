## Gini Coefficients

This project seeks to recover lognormal distributions (mu, sigma) from known national values of national income, Gini coefficients, and national income per capita.

The World Bank reports time series cross-sectional data for GNI, GNI per capita, and Gini coefficients for a wide range of countries.

This project fits lognormal income distributions that match the data for each country, creating maximum likelihood estimates of personal income based on the World Bank data.
